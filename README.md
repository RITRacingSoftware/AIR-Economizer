To program the ATtiny:
1. Connect ATtiny to an Arduino configured as a programmer. Consult the Arduino
   documentation for more details on this process.
3. Execute `set_fuses.sh` with the port as its argument (e.g. `./set_fuses.sh /dev/ttyACM0`)
4. Execute `program.sh` with the port as its argument (e.g. `./program.sh /dev/ttyACM0`)
